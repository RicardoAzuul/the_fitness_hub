                <p>If your not comfortable using the free weights, we have plenty of fixed Resistance weights.<br>
                These weights are perfect for starters at the gym, as you you have resistance weights for each part of your body.<br>
                They will show you what muscles you will be working for that machine, get the same weight options as free weights<br>
                and they show you  what to do at each machine via a diagram.<br>
                Do not get us wrong they are not just for starters at the gym, anyone can use them! Some people prefer them to free weights.<br>
                It all comes down to you as the trainers preferences.</p>
